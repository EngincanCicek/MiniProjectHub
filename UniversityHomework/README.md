# UniversityHomework
This repository houses my homework projects prepared for my university courses. A majority of these projects are written in C#.

## Content
The projects in this folder are generally assignments designed for specific courses. Some of these projects may cover topics that are specific to a region or Turkey. In addition, some projects might be in the Turkish language. These projects reflect various topics and concepts that I learned during my university education.

## How to Use
Each directory contains a .cs file and there may also be a .exe output file. You can directly interact with these files. To review a project, navigate to the appropriate directory, and inspect the code and any existing .cs file. Moreover, the entire source code will be shared for some relatively larger projects.

## Contribution
As this repository is a platform where I share my personal homework, I generally do not accept contributions. However, please do not hesitate to get in touch with me for any questions, comments, or feedback.

## Contact
If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact me. My contact information can be found in the main README.md file.

Thank you, and happy coding!
